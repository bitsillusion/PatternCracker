## Features
PatternCracker offers the following key features:

1. **Creating Patterns**: Easily create patterns by selecting specific points on the grid. PatternCracker will generate all possible combinations of patterns that touch only those selected points.

2. **Visualizing Patterns from a Pattern Hash**: Visualize a pattern by inputting a pattern hash. Please note that this feature requires root access on the device to obtain the pattern hash.

3. **Creating Pattern Hashes**: Generate pattern hashes using a variety of hashing algorithms to enhance pattern security.

4. **Pattern Decryption**: Utilize PatternCracker's efficient decryption algorithms to crack patterns.

## Fine-Tuning the Pattern
When working with PatternCracker, you can fine-tune the pattern decryption process by specifying the following:

- **Starting Point**: Define the first dot or side of the pattern.
- **Crossing the Middle Line**: Indicate if lines cross the middle line without touching.
- **Ending Point**: Specify the last dot or side.
- **Pattern Direction**: Set the pattern direction, such as "UP," "DOWN," "LEFT," "RIGHT," to accurately decrypt patterns like 1586249, which represent a sequence of directional movements.
